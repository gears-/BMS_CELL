Sample packets to send:

$02FCFF 0001FF 0001FF 02F4FF$\\

Where:

start packet ~~~ second cell request

$\overbrace{02FCFF} \underbrace{0001FF} \overbrace{0001FF} \underbrace{02F4FF}$

~~~~~~~~~~ first cell request ~~~ end packet\\

Start packet:

number of cells~ CRC

$\overbrace{02}~~~~~\underbrace{FC}~~~~~\overbrace{FF}$

~~~~~~~start packet\\

Request packet (numbers of packets the same as numbers of cells):

data~~~~~~~ CRC

$\overbrace{00~~0}\underbrace{1}~\overbrace{FF}$

~~~~~~~command\\

Commands list:

$1$ --- Cell voltage request

$2$ --- Cell temperature request

$3$ --- Cell load request

$5$ --- Cell charge/discharge cycles request

$9$ --- Send voltage calibration data

$A$ --- Send temperature calibration data

$B$ --- Set load state 

$D$ --- Increase cell charge/discharge cycles\\

End packet:

number of cells~ CRC

$\overbrace{02}~~~~~\underbrace{FC}~~~~~\overbrace{FF}$

~~~~~~~end packet\\


Examples of request packets and answers:\\

\S 1 Read Cell Voltage:

Send - 0001FF

Receive like - DAEFFF - 3502 mV; where DAE is HEX value of 3502\\

\S 2 Read Cell Temperature:

Send - 0002FF

Receive like - 01CFFF - $28 ^{o}C$; where 01C is HEX value of 28\\

\S 3 Read Load State:

Send - 0003FF

Receive Like - 038FFF - 56\%; where 038 is HEX value of 56\\

\S 4 Set Load State:

000BFF - 0\% load

064BFF - 100\% load; where 064 is HEX value of 100\\

\S 5 Calibrate Cell Voltage:

D809FF - Set measured voltage to 3456 mV; where D80 is HEX value of 3456\\

\S 6 Calibrate Cell Temperature:

020AFF - Set measured Temperature to $32 ^{o}C$; where 020 is HEX value of 32\\


Remark - 'FF' is CRC field, now not implemented yet, for simple debugging main algorithm.
